Corpora Database Management System

Background
===========

The Corpora Database Management Database System, or the Corpora DBMS, was developed as a 
Computer Science undergraduate project at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er-Sheva, Israel.
It was created for researchers at the Natural Language Processing laboratory, with intent to assist them 
with their ongoing research of the Hebrew language.

So, What Exactly is the Corpora DBMS?
======================================
In a nutshell, the Corpora DBMS is a web-application that allows a user to analyze Hebrew sentences 
and index them into a database.
The analysis of each new sentence returns various properties of the sentence, and these properties are 
indexed alongside the sentence. 
This way, researchers can gradually build a corpus of analyzed Hebrew sentences, with the ability to 
retrieve information about them via queries sent to the database.
